- [ ] Onboard new contributors with up-to-date guides and roadmap references
- [ ] Maintain and update the Integration & Technical Plan as new research emerges
- [ ] Recurring reviews, docs sync, onboarding feedback

**Estimated Effort:** Ongoing

## Rationale

This phased roadmap is designed to:
- **Stabilize the codebase and enforce best practices** before layering on complexity.
- **Integrate testing and schema validation early** to catch regressions and enforce contracts.
- **Establish prompt governance and RAG foundation** for robust, adaptive agent workflows.
- **Prioritize CI/CD, observability, and security** to ensure reliability and compliance from the start.
- **Enable extensibility and advanced features** only after the core is stable and observable.
- **Maintain a living process** of review, documentation, and onboarding to support sustainable growth.

**Sequence reasoning:**
- Codebase stabilization and documentation are prerequisites for all further work.
- Testing and schema validation must precede prompt and RAG enhancements to ensure correctness.
- Prompt governance and RAG are core to agent quality and must be in place before scaling up.
- CI/CD, observability, and security are critical for production readiness and must be enforced before extensibility.
- Advanced services and plugin support are last, as they depend on a stable, observable, and secure foundation.

## Integration & Technical Plan (2024)

This section summarizes the latest integration and technical plan, synthesizing best practices and research for Rocketship. For full details, see the 'Integration & Technical Plan' in [Feature_Enhancements.md](../Feature_Enhancements.md).

**Key Enhancements:**
- Graph-based, multi-agent orchestration (Planâ†’Dispatchâ†’Resolve)
- Unified MemoryService (vector + knowledge graph)
- Dynamic ToolRegistry with circuit breaking and runtime registration
- CriticAgent, ReflectionAgent, and feedback loops
- Explainability, audit logging, and human-in-the-loop (HITL) checkpoints
- OpenTelemetry-based observability and dashboards
- Prompt metadata, evaluation, and governance
- Strict modularity, performance, and extension points

**Implementation Phases:**
1. Orchestration & Memory Foundation
2. Agentic Enhancements
3. Observability, Security, and Governance
4. UI & Extensibility

Each phase below has been updated to reflect these priorities.
