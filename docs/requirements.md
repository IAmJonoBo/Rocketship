This document defines the vision, objectives, use cases, scope, and acceptance criteria for Rocketship. All requirements are aligned with the Integration & Technical Plan and project roadmap.

---

## 1. Vision

Rocketship aims to be the fastest, most extensible, and intelligent agentic automation platform for VS Code and modern software projects. It orchestrates specialized AI agents to automate, refactor, and enhance codebases, with a focus on modularity, observability, and developer experience.

---

## 2. Objectives
- Automate complex software workflows using multi-agent orchestration
- Provide robust validation, circuit breaking, and schema enforcement
- Enable adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for context-rich automation
- Support plugin and extension development for custom workflows
- Ensure security, compliance, and auditability by design
- Deliver a seamless, observable, and maintainable developer experience

---

## 3. Use Cases
- Automated code refactoring, scaffolding, and testing
- Multi-agent planning, coding, review, and deployment
- Retrieval-augmented code and documentation generation
- Continuous integration, observability, and compliance automation
- Custom agent/plugin development for domain-specific workflows

---

## 4. Scope
**In Scope:**
- VS Code extension and CLI companion
- Core and advanced agent orchestration (Planner, Coder, Critic, Tester, etc.)
- RAG pipeline, PKGService, and vector store integration
- Plugin/extension system and lifecycle management
- Observability, telemetry, and dashboards
- Security, compliance, and audit logging

**Out of Scope:**
- Proprietary/closed-source model integrations (unless opt-in)
- Non-ESM/legacy build systems
- Non-VS Code IDEs (for v1)

---

## 5. Acceptance Criteria
- All core and advanced agents are implemented and tested
- RAG pipeline and PKGService are operational and observable
- Plugin/extension system is documented and validated
- CI/CD, security, and observability gates are enforced
- Documentation is complete, up-to-date, and cross-referenced
- All requirements are tracked in the roadmap and TODOs
