## Summary
This Requirements & Scope document defines Rocketship’s vision, objectives, user personas, and prioritized use cases to align stakeholders, mitigate scope creep, and guide AI-driven, LLM-assisted development workflows. It establishes clear boundaries between core and optional features, ensuring a focused MVP while enabling extensibility through optional plugins and staged releases.  

## 1. Vision & Objectives
- **Vision:** Enable seamless, end-to-end software development automation within VS Code by leveraging multi-agent orchestration, hybrid retrieval (vector + knowledge graph), on-the-fly fine-tuning, and persistent memory for self-improving productivity citeturn0search9.
- **Objectives:**
  1. **Plan → Code → Test Pipeline:** Automate requirement planning, code synthesis, and test generation workflows with minimal user intervention citeturn0search8.
  2. **Core Extensibility:** Architect a plugin-first model where advanced capabilities (LoRA adapters, contextual bandits, Reflexion meta-learning) can be toggled in `rocketship.yaml` citeturn0search2.
  3. **Performance on Constrained Hardware:** Optimize for M1 MacBook Pro (16 GB RAM) and similar environments via lazy loading, dynamic throttling, and separate inference processes citeturn0search0.
  4. **Security & Compliance:** Enforce sandboxing for auto-downloaded models, secret isolation via VS Code’s SecretStorage, and SOC 2 readiness for audit logs and data handling citeturn0search3.

## 2. User Stories & Personas
### 2.1 Personas
- **Novice Developer:** Seeks guidance through boilerplate generation and test scaffolding to accelerate onboarding citeturn0search1.
- **AI-Power User:** Customizes pipelines with LoRA adapters, PKG retrieval, and Reflexion loops to optimize project-specific workflows citeturn0search6.
- **DevOps Engineer:** Uses CLI companion and CI hooks for automated plan/code/test validation in pipelines, ensuring reproducible releases citeturn0search7.

### 2.2 User Stories
1. *“As a Novice Developer, I want Rocketship to generate unit-test templates for my functions so that I can quickly validate edge cases without writing boilerplate.”* citeturn0search8  
2. *“As an AI-Power User, I want to fine-tune the base model with my code style via LoRA adapters, so that suggestions match our team’s conventions.”* citeturn1academia11  
3. *“As a DevOps Engineer, I want a headless `rocketship --ci plan` command integrated in GitHub Actions, so that code scaffolding and linting run automatically on PRs.”* citeturn3search2  

## 3. Use-Case Catalog
| ID  | Title                                  | Description                                                                                          | Priority |
|-----|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| UC1 | Requirement Analysis                   | Use language models to parse user requirements and output structured tasks in Rocketship’s Planner. | High     |
| UC2 | Contextual Code Generation             | Generate code stubs based on current file context, RAG-augmented by PKG and vector retrieval.       | High     |
| UC3 | Automated Testing                      | Create unit and integration tests using the Test Agent, with coverage reports via SWE-bench.        | High     |
| UC4 | On-the-Fly Fine-Tuning                 | Apply LoRA adapters trained on repo history to improve subsequent code suggestions.                  | Medium   |
| UC5 | Adaptive Model Selection               | Dynamically select best model/quantisation combo via contextual bandit feedback loops.               | Medium   |
| UC6 | Long-Term Session Memory               | Store and recall previous plan outcomes and user preferences across sessions.                        | Medium   |
| UC7 | Self-Reflection & Meta-Optimization    | After each workflow, run ReflexionAgent to summarise lessons and update orchestration policies.      | Low      |

## 4. Scope Boundaries
- **In-Scope (v1 MVP):** UC1, UC2, UC3; core ArchitectService, HybridRetrievalService (vector-only), basic MemoryService (session-only), Planner/Coder/Tester Agents, VS Code UI panels, CLI companion.  
- **Out-of-Scope (v1 MVP):** UC4–UC7; advanced PKG integration, LoRA, Bandits, persistent memory, Reflexion, curated plugin registry, SOC 2 compliance.  
- **v2+ Additions:** Progressive enablement of UC4–UC7 behind feature toggles, PKG schema, SOC 2 audit-log storage, telemetry dashboards.  

## 5. Acceptance Criteria
- **Functional:** Each UC must have automated tests covering end-to-end flows with ≥ 80% code coverage.  
- **Performance:** Activation to first Plan panel load < 2 s on M1 Mac; code generation latency < 3 s per 512‐token request.  
- **Security:** No CLI command or extension activation should expose secrets in logs; models must be checksum‑verified pre-load.
