- Fork the repository and clone your fork.
- Install dependencies with `pnpm install`.

## 4. Branching & PR Workflow
- Branch from `develop` for features, `main` for hotfixes.
- Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/agent-refactor`, `fix/test-flake`).
- Keep PRs focused and small; large changes should be split into logical commits.
- Reference related issues or TODOs in your PR description.
- Ensure all tests pass and docs are updated before requesting review.

- All PRs require at least one approval from a Maintainer or Committer.
- Address all review comments and re-request review as needed.
- Major changes may require Steering Committee review (see [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md)).

## 7. Proposing Features & ADRs
- For new features or architectural changes, open an issue or draft an ADR (see [docs/adr/](docs/adr/) and [onboarding.md](docs/onboarding.md)).
- Use the ADR template in `docs/adr/README.md`.

## 8. Where to Find Help
