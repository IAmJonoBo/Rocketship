> - [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md)
> - [Feature_Enhancements.md](Feature_Enhancements.md)

This file is the actionable, up-to-date checklist for all outstanding work in the Rocketship project. Each TODO references the relevant section in [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md). Update this file and the roadmap together after every major batch of changes.

---

## How to Use This File
- Check off items as you complete them, and update the roadmap accordingly.
- For detailed context, dependencies, and quality gates, see the referenced roadmap section.
- Add new TODOs here and in the roadmap as the project evolves.

- [ ] Scaffold minimal unit and contract test files for each agent/service
- [ ] Refactor contract tests to use dynamic ports
- [ ] Implement real agent calls in contract tests
- [ ] Ensure integration tests skip gracefully if Docker/Testcontainers is unavailable
- [ ] Scaffold or update JSON schema files for each agent's output
- [ ] Integrate schema validation in each agent's `execute` method (Ajv)
- [ ] Emit telemetry for validation success/failure
- [ ] Expand `docs/testing.md` with test strategies, troubleshooting, and coverage reporting
- [ ] Achieve â‰¥80% test coverage, schema validation, contract test pass

## Phase 3: Prompt Governance & RAG Foundation ([roadmap](docs/roadmap.md#phase-3-prompt-governance--rag-foundation))
- [ ] Scaffold minimal `.tpl` prompt templates for all agents (with version/timestamp headers and TODOs)

- [ ] Emit telemetry on prompt load/version
- [ ] Scaffold/implement token-based chunking and real embedding model in RAG pipeline
- [ ] Emit telemetry for RAG ingestion, retrieval, deduplication
- [ ] Expand `docs/prompts.md` and RAG sections in `docs/architecture.md`
- [ ] Ensure prompt lint, RAG telemetry, prompt versioning

## Phase 4: CI/CD, Observability, Security ([roadmap](docs/roadmap.md#phase-4-cicd-observability-security))

- [ ] CI green, SAST/DAST pass, dashboards live
- [ ] Instrument all core services and agents with OpenTelemetry
- [ ] Build minimal dashboard (VS Code webview or web UI) for real-time monitoring

## Phase 4.5: Disaster Recovery Drills & Automated Failover Tests ([roadmap](docs/roadmap.md#phase-45-disaster-recovery-drills--automated-failover-tests))
- [ ] Automate regular backups for LanceDB (vector DB) and audit logs
- [ ] Scaffold and schedule restore/failover drills for LanceDB and audit logs
- [ ] Implement health check scripts for vector DB and audit log integrity

- [ ] Document DR procedures and runbooks in docs/disaster-recovery.md
- [ ] Integrate DR status into observability dashboards

## Phase 4.6: Resilience, Self-Healing, and Continuous Learning ([roadmap](docs/roadmap.md#phase-46-resilience-self-healing-and-continuous-learning))
- [ ] Scaffold and implement SupervisorService (singleton, global fallback, snapshot/rollback, config-driven)

- [ ] Add agent-level defensive middleware/interceptors, with per-agent config in rocketship.yaml
- [ ] Register DuckDuckGo tool (global, agent-scoped, Redis cache, rate limits, fallback providers)
- [ ] Scaffold TrainerAgent (nightly/manual, curated sources, vector store namespace)
- [ ] Implement ReflexionAgent prompt update proposal and lessons storage in LanceDB
- [ ] Add config stubs for caching, rate-limits, and search providers (global + per-tool)
- [ ] Instrument all resilience/self-healing events with OpenTelemetry and expose in dashboards
- [ ] Create and maintain docs/resilience.md for all resilience/self-healing patterns

## Phase 5: Advanced Services & Plugin Extensibility ([roadmap](docs/roadmap.md#phase-5-advanced-services--plugin-extensibility))
