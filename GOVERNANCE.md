# Rocketship Governance

> For terminology, see the [glossary](docs/glossary.md). For onboarding, see [docs/onboarding.md](docs/onboarding.md).

## Governance Model

Rocketship is governed by a **Steering Committee** model:
- The Steering Committee oversees project direction, major decisions, and dispute resolution.
- Day-to-day work is open to all contributors via pull requests and issues.

## Roles & Responsibilities

- **Maintainer:** Core team member with merge rights and release responsibilities.
- **Committer:** Trusted contributor with write access to specific areas.
- **Contributor:** Anyone submitting issues, PRs, or documentation.

## Decision-Making Process

- **Consensus Seeking:** Most decisions are made by consensus in issues or PRs.
- **Major Changes:** Require Steering Committee review and, if needed, a vote (majority wins).
- **ADR Process:** Architectural decisions are logged as ADRs in `docs/adr/`.

## Dispute Resolution

- Raise concerns in the relevant GitHub issue or PR.
- If unresolved, escalate to the Steering Committee via a tagged issue.
- The Committee will mediate and, if needed, call a vote.

## Proposing Changes

- Open a GitHub issue or PR describing the change.
- For major changes, submit an ADR and request review from the Steering Committee.
- All contributors are encouraged to participate in discussions.

## Joining the Committee

- Maintainers nominate new Committee members based on sustained, high-quality contributions.
- The Committee votes to approve new members.

## Code of Conduct

- All participants must follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) (CNCF template).
- Violations may result in removal from the project or Committee.

## Escalation

- For urgent or sensitive issues, email the Committee at the address listed in the repository.
